## About Me 🐧
Hi there! I'm **Xodios**, a human  with a love for penguins (who doesn't love those waddling cuties, right? 🐧). This repository is where I document my journey through **Kaggle Learn**, as I explore and master topics like data science, machine learning, and beyond (though this is jutst collect certifcate and revise some stuff cause I forget a lot).  

When I'm not learning, I enjoy finding new ways to waddle through life's challenges (just like penguins). Whether it’s coding, analyzing data, or just being curious, I strive to keep moving forward with a touch of fun and a love for knowledge.
